Analyzed sales growth, customer segmentation, and product
performance using advanced MySQL queries. I identified top-
performing branches, profitable product lines, and anomalies in
sales transactions to improve strategies. I segmented customers
into spending tiers, identified repeat buyers, and analyzed
payment preferences by city. I delivered actionable insights
through SQL-driven analysis, enhancing decision-making with
clear visualizations and reports.
