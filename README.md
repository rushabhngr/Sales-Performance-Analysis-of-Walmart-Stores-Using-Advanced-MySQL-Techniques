# Project Title  
**Sales Performance Analysis of Walmart Stores Using MySQL**

## 1. Introduction  
Walmart, one of the largest retail corporations, generates massive amounts of transactional data across its branches in different cities. Analyzing this data provides valuable insights into customer behavior, product performance, sales trends, and operational efficiency.  

This project leverages **advanced SQL queries** to process and analyze Walmart’s sales dataset. By applying aggregation, joins, subqueries, and window functions, meaningful insights are extracted that support data-driven decision-making.
